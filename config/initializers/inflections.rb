# Add new iNFLection rules using the following format. INFLections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
# ActiveSupport::INFLector.iNFLections(:en) do |iNFLect|
#   iNFLect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
#   iNFLect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
#   iNFLect.irregular 'person', 'people'
#   iNFLect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
# end

# These iNFLection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::INFLector.iNFLections(:en) do |iNFLect|
#   iNFLect.acronym 'RESTful'
# end
